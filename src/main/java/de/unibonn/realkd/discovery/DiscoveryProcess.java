/**
 * <p>
 * Models the interaction of a user with the output of pattern mining algorithms
 * in an incremental round-based fashion (together with
 * {@link DiscoveryProcessState}) and allows clients to observe this
 * interaction.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * At all times patterns under consideration are partitioned into three sets:
 * </p>
 * 1. result patterns---containing patterns that the user currently considers as
 * the results of her analysis; these patterns are persistent through round
 * transitions.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * 2. discarded patterns---containing patterns that have been explicitly marked
 * by the user to not be shown again; also this list is persistent through round
 * transitions.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * 3. candidate patterns---containing new patterns that are currently presented
 * to the user to potentially augment her result set; a new round starts with a
 * new set of candidates.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The class provides three public methods to move patterns between these three
 * sets (addCandidateToResults, deletePatternFromCandidates,
 * deletePatternFromResults) and one method to start a new round with a new set
 * of candidate patterns ({@link #nextRound(List)}). Additionally, through
 * {@link #endRound()}, there is the possibility to enter a state where the
 * current round has ended (i.e., the move operations between the sets has no
 * effect), but no new round with new candidates has started yet.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Observers (implementing {@link DiscoveryProcessObserver}) can register to
 * receive notifications about all these operations happening.
 * </p>
